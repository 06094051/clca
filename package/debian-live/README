# CLCA on Debian Live (Live Root CA)
This directory contains the build environment for packaging CLCA
and assorted tools in a bootable Debian Live CD.

To build the image run ./build-iso.sh on a Debian system (requires
the live-build package).

## Base build
The base build contains the base tools clca (for CA operation) and
secret (for optional secret sharing).

## Custom build

### Thales/nCipher nFast HSM support
The addon script addons.d/50-nfast.sh scans for the distribution files
of the Thales/nCipher nFast drivers in this directory.

If the addon detects a file with the file pattern

nCSS-linux-user-*zip

in this directory, it will automatically include the drivers in the
generated ISO.

In addition, the default user is changed from "user" to "nfast" to
make HSM operations easier for the operator.

## Customizing options

### Custom startup exection

If the user's (persistent) home directory contains an executable file
~/.rc.local it will be executed **as root** on startup.

### Custom background image

If the user's (persistent) home directory contains the file .xrootimage.png
it will be displayed on the background of the graphical environment.
